Comments:
---------
There is no main() in your BoundedBuffer.java file and there is no file
"BoundedBufferTester.java" with a main() either.  I gave you partial
credit for the two, 20 out of 30.

Problem8.c doesn't compile.  This is because there is a type mismatch
between the type double and clock_t.  If you cast the arguments to the
"printf()" to double, it should work.  I took 5 points off for that.
